# Installation

We have two methods of installation: **Automatic** and **Manual.** We also have a **Steam Workshop** page that has a similar method to **Manual**.

## Automatic

???+ info 
    Automatic instructions only work on Windows for now. A Linux version of the installer is being worked on, and for now it should work in Wine, but there's still extra setup on there for now.

???+ info 
    We'll make this more automatic in the future, bear with us.

6. Run `REPENTOGONUpdater.exe`.
    - This opens a new window.
7. Press `Install`.
    -   Once the log at the bottom says `Finished!`, installation is done. If the log instead says *anything* about failing, the installation was unsuccessful. Try a different method.
