# Welcome to the new era of Isaac modding!

After nearly a year of hard work, we are proud to finally release REPENTOGON into the world! As our gift to the modding community as we head into the Year of the Dragon, we have rekindled the smoldering embers of the Isaac API into a flame that has never burned brighter.

REPENTOGON is a *script extender*, a concept you may be familiar with if you have ever modded some other games, especially Bethesda titles. These important mods make the game's modding API more flexible and powerful, significantly expanding the capabilities of mods. Many mods for those games simply wouldn't be possible without them! We feel that Isaac has similar untapped potential. The game's formula inherently allows for infinite expansion, and yet the base API simply cannot provide anything close to a level of power that allows for this concept to truly come to fruition.

Our ultimate goal is to reduce the amount of asinine workarounds needed in order for modders to changee basic functionality. The base API doesn't even have a clean way to add items that do something when picked up! With over 800 new functions and over 200 new callbacks, we've eliminated many of these problems.

REPENTOGON is free and open source, and always will be. We're far from finished- expect even more new features in the future.

Head over to the [installation guide](../../install.md) to get started. PLEASE let us know of any bugs or crashes that arise- we've done lots of testing but can't possibly predict every single mod configuration.
