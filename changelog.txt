	- Every tag that exists on at least one item in items.xml will also be triggered by CacheFlag.CACHE_ALL
	- REPENTOGON adds one custom cache tag (so far): "familiarmultiplier". Note that this one does not trigger MC_EVALUATE_CUSTOM_CACHE, instead triggering MC_EVALUATE_FAMILIAR_MULTIPLIER for each familiar.

	- MC_POST_ROOM_TRIGGER_EFFECT_REMOVED (ItemConfigItem)
	- MC_PRE_X_GRID_COLLISION and MC_X_GRID_COLLISION (EntityX, int gridIndex, GridEntity or nil) - PLAYER/TEAR/FAMILIAR/BOMB/PICKUP/PROJECTILE/NPC, Return true on PRE to ignore collision.

* Added the "noshake" attribute to the players.xml which can "disable" the player portrait shaking animation in the nightmare scene/boss intro

* Added the following customtags for items.xml:
	* "nometronome" - Prevents the item from being picked by Metronome
	* "revive" - Each copy of the collectible/trinket/null effect held counts as an extra life (on the HUD, etc) and prevents the game from deleting the run save upon death, making reviving the player safe. You must still remove the item and actually revive the player yourself.
	* "reviveeffect" - Same as "revive", but applies to the corresponding TemporaryEffect of the collectible/trinket (you'd probably want to set their effects to be persistent). There is no difference between "revive" and "reviveeffect" for null items.
	* "chancerevive" - If item is counted as an extra life, displays a "?" next to the extra life count, like Guppy's Collar.
	* "hiddenrevive" - If item is counted as an extra life, this prevents it from being counted on the hud. Overrides "chancerevive".
* Improved startup time! (for both REPENTOGON and the game itself)
* Buffed Trisagion
* Added a new option in "Vanilla tweaks" section called "Fast lasers", it tracks the game's lag and (if present) reduces the number of samples used by lasers to ensure better performance
